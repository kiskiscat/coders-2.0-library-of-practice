        <p>The effectiveness of the Tax-Loss Harvesting strategy to reduce the tax liability of the client will depend
            on the client’s entire tax and investment profile, including purchases and dispositions in a client’s (or
            client’s spouse’s) accounts outside of Wealthfront Advisers and type of investments (e.g., taxable or
            nontaxable) or holding period (e.g., short- term or long-term).Tax loss harvesting may generate a higher
            number of trades due to attempts to capture losses. There is a chance that trading attributed to tax loss
            harvesting may create capital gains and wash sales and could be subject to higher transaction costs and
            market impacts. In addition, tax loss harvesting strategies may produce losses, which may not be offset by
            sufficient gains in the account and may be limited to a $3,000 deduction against income. The utilization of
            losses harvested through the strategy will depend upon the recognition of capital gains in the same or a
            future tax period, and in addition may be subject to limitations under applicable tax laws, e.g., if there
            are insufficient realized gains in the tax period, the use of harvested losses may be limited to a $3,000
            deduction against income and distributions. Losses harvested through the strategy that are not utilized in
            the tax period when recognized (e.g., because of insufficient capital gains and/or significant capital loss
            carryforwards), generally may be carried forward to offset future capital gains, if any.</p>
